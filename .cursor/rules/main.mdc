# Specification File Reference

Always read and reference the file `specs/core.yaml` as the specification document for this project.

Before making any code changes or answering questions about the project architecture:
1. First read the specification file at `specs/core.yaml`
2. Ensure your responses and code align with the specifications defined in that file
3. If there's any conflict between the spec and the current request, point out the discrepancy

The specification file should be treated as the source of truth for:
- Project architecture
- Design patterns
- Coding standards
- API contracts
- Business logic rules

When writing code, always verify it matches the specifications in `specs/core.yaml`.
